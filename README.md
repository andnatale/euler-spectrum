# Spectrum tools for 2d Euler

Python toolbox for evaluation of energy spectrum from 2d Euler computations using Firedrake.

Codes to perform tests in:

A. Natale, C.J. Cotter. Scale-selective dissipation in energy-conserving finite element schemes for atmospheric flow
simulations. *Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society*, 143(705):1734-1745, arXiv:1611.02623 , 2017.


## Includes

spectrum_example.py --> Sample computation of energy spectrum from stream function

euler_example.py --> Code to perform test as in Natale and Cotter 2017

spectrum_example_tools.py --> Class for spectrum evaluation
